# Go Template Delimiter Example

This is an example of how to write a go template that ranges over a slice of objects and properly renders delimiters between the elements.  Such that, there is only a delimiter between elements and not a leading or trailing delimiter.

To run, simply clone the repo and then:

```
cd go-template-delimiter-example && go run .
```
